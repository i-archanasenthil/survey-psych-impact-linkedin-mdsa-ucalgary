**Student Survey Analysis - README**

This repository outlines the steps and methodologies used to conduct an email-based survey on students and analyze the responses using various statistical techniques. The key analyses performed are:

1) Score Test
2) Spearman Correlation Test
3) Decision Tree

**Survey Distribution**
The survey was distributed via email to a group of students. An invitation to participate in the survey was sent with a link to the survey form. Responses were collected anonymously to ensure privacy.

**Statistical Tests**
**Score Test**
The score test was used to compare different proportions or rates between subgroups of the student population. This test helps evaluate whether the observed differences in proportions are statistically significant.
**Steps:**
Define the null and alternative hypotheses.
Compute the test statistic based on survey data.
Evaluate the p-value to assess statistical significance.

**Spearman Correlation Test**
The Spearman rank correlation test was used to determine the relationship between two ordinal variables, such as the relationship between the number of study hours and academic satisfaction.
**Steps:**
Rank the data for each variable.
Compute the Spearman correlation coefficient.
Evaluate whether the correlation is statistically significant.

**Decision Tree**
A decision tree analysis was performed to predict a student's level of satisfaction based on their responses to various survey questions. The decision tree algorithm models the relationships between variables and creates a tree structure that helps in predicting outcomes.
**Steps:**
Preprocess the survey data and handle any missing values.
Train the decision tree model using the survey responses.
Visualize the decision tree to understand decision-making patterns.

**Data Analysis**
The collected survey data was cleaned and preprocessed before performing the above statistical tests. Missing values were handled using appropriate imputation techniques, and the data was split into training and test sets for the decision tree analysis.

**Results and Insights**
**Score Test:** The test revealed statistically significant differences between satisfaction levels among students based on their involvement in extracurricular activities.
**Spearman Correlation:** A moderate positive correlation was found between the number of study hours and academic satisfaction.
**Decision Tree:** The decision tree identified that the number of hours spent on extracurricular activities is a key predictor of academic satisfaction.

**Conclusion**
The survey and subsequent analysis provided valuable insights into student behavior, satisfaction, and the factors affecting academic performance. The results can be used to develop strategies for improving student engagement and academic outcomes.
